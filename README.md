Aviation data analysis

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-
time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number

of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights appears in DOT’s monthly Air Travel Consumer
Report, published about 30 days after the month’s end, as well as in summary tables posted on this
website. Summary statistics and raw data are made available to the public at the time the Air Travel
Consumer Report is released.
